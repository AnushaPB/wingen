## Simulation Example

**Basics:**

The simulation example was executed using the `run_simex.sh` script which runs the Geonomics simulation and then the time tests to generate all of the rasters and time data for the different dataset types.

The results and figures from the paper were created using the `simex_notebook.Rmd` and `runtime_notebook.Rmd`

**Directory structure:**

```
[simex]
|   run_simex.sh* - main script to run simulations and generate results
|   simex_notebook.Rmd* - main notebook for simulation analyses
|   simex_notebook.md - knitted simex_notebook.Rmd
│   simex_functions.R* - functions used for simulation example analysis
|   create_middle_earth.R - used to create middle_earth.csv from DEM layers
|   gnxsim.py - script to run geonomics simulations
|   runtime_notebook.Rmd - main notebook for runtime analyses and figures
|   runtime_notebook.md - knitted runtime_notebook.Rmd 
|   runtime_functions.R - functions used for runtime analysis
|   simex_figures.Rmd* - notebook used to create plots for figures

└───[outputs] - directory for results from time tests
```

## Empirical Example

**Basics:**

The results and figures from the paper were created using the `empex_notebook.Rmd`

**Directory structure:**

```
[paperex]
|   empex_notebook.Rmd* - main notebook for empirical analyses and figures
|   empex_notebook.md - knitted empex_notebook.Rmd
