Generate continuous maps of genetic diversity using moving windows with options for rarefaction, kriging, and masking.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AnushaPB/wingen", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the basic functionality of wingen using a subset of the simulated data from Bishop et al. (202X). For more details about this dataset, see the [original paper](LINK) and the package vignette.

```{r, comment = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library(wingen)
# Load example data
load_middle_earth_ex()
```

The core function of this package is `window_gd()`, which takes as inputs a vcfR object (or a path to a .vcf file), sample coordinates, and a raster layer which the moving window will slide across. Users can control the genetic diversity statistic that is calculated (`stat`), the window dimensions (`wdim`), the aggregation factor to use on the raster (`fact`), whether to perform rarefaction (`rarify`), and other aspects of the moving window calculations. Additional arguments for this function are described in the vignette and function documentation.

```{r window_gd, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, results = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
# Run moving window calculations of pi with rarefaction
wgd <- window_gd(lotr_vcf,
          lotr_coords,
          lotr_lyr,
          stat = "pi",
          wdim = 5,
          fact = 4,
          rarify = TRUE)

# Use plot_gd() to plot the genetic diversity layer and plot_count() to plot the sample counts layer
par(mfrow = c(1,2), oma = rep(1,4), mar = rep(2,4))
plot_gd(wgd, bkg = lotr_range, main = "Moving window pi", legend.width = 1.5)
plot_count(wgd, main = "Moving window sample counts", legend.width = 1.5)
```

Next, the output from `window_gd()` can be interpolated using kriging with the `krig_gd()` function.

```{r krig_gd, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, results = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
# Krige results
kgd <- krig_gd(wgd[["pi"]], lotr_lyr)
kgd_counts <- krig_gd(wgd[["sample_count"]], lotr_lyr)

par(mfrow = c(1,2), oma = rep(1,4), mar = rep(2,4))
plot_gd(kgd, main = "Kriged pi", legend.width = 1.5)
plot_count(kgd_counts, main = "Kriged sample counts", legend.width = 1.5)
```

Finally, the output from `krig_gd()` (or `window_gd()`) can be masked to exclude areas that fall outside of the study area or that were undersampled. 

```{r mask_gd, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, results = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
# Mask results that fall outside of the "range"
mgd_lyr <- mask_gd(kgd, lotr_range, minval = 0.01)

# Further mask results in areas where the sample count was less than minval
mgd_counts <- mask_gd(mgd_lyr, kgd_counts, minval = 3)
```

```{r result, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, results = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
# Plot results
par(mfrow = c(1,2), oma = rep(1,4), mar = rep(2,4))
plot_gd(mgd_lyr, main = "Masked pi (range)", legend.width = 1.5)
plot_gd(mgd_counts, bkg = lotr_range, main = "Masked pi (sample counts + range)", legend.width = 1.5)
```
